            <div class="section-content">
                <p>SwaHeal is a unique mobile app for Emotional First Aid developed by experienced and qualified mental health professionals.</p>
                <p>Emotional First Aid is like Physical First Aid. We use and apply first aid measures like bandages, ointments, etc to protect further damage to health in case of injuries. If we fail to develop, maintain and strengthen our emotional health, we are likely to suffer from a lower quality of life. So, we must have some handy, easy yet effective psychological measures in case of day-to-day emotional injuries like frustrations, failures, stress, worries, rejections, anger, loss etc.</p>
                <p>SwaHeal is a self-help tool for Emotional First Aid. Here you will get personalized first aid measures depending upon:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your emotional injury</li>
                    <li>Its severity</li>
                    <li>Painful emotion associated with it and</li>
                    <li>Reason behind emotional injury you have.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In today’s competitive world no one can escape the various stresses that we are exposed to in different situations. And we are no exception to this; in fact we might be at a higher risk of being stressed. The various stresses that we come across are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Personal stress</li>
                    <li>Relationship stress</li>
                    <li>Emotional stress</li>
                    <li>Family stress</li>
                    <li>Exam stress</li>
                    <li>Peer pressure</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And the list goes on. Notably most of us do not talk about these issues as we feel shy, embarrassed or simply cannot identify that we need help for dealing with these issues. And it is a well-known fact that these kinds of hidden issues surely impact our performance.</p>
