            <div class="section-content">
                <p>SwaHeal is a unique mobile app for Emotional First Aid, developed by experienced and qualified mental health professionals.</p>
                <p>Emotional First Aid is like physical first-aid which we use and apply in the form of bandages, ointments, etc to protect further damage in case of injuries. Similarly, we must have some handy and easy yet effective psychological measures in case of day-to-day emotional injuries like frustrations, failures, stress, worries, rejections, anger, loss etc.</p>
                <p>If we fail to timely develop, maintain and strengthen our emotional health, we are likely to suffer from a lower quality of life.</p>
                <p>In todayâ€™s competitive world no one can escape the various stresses that we are exposed to in different situations.</p>
                <p>The various stresses that we come across are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Personal stress</li>
                    <li>Relationship stress</li>
                    <li>Emotional stress</li>
                    <li>Family stress</li>
                    <li>Exam stress</li>
                    <li>Peer pressure</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And the list goes on. Notably, most of us do not talk about these issues as we feel shy, embarrassed or simply cannot identify that we need help for dealing with these issues. And it is a well-known fact that these kinds of hidden issues surely impact our performance, unless we develop a healthy life-style.</p>
