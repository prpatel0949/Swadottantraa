                <div class="page-subtitle">Mental Health and Wellness</div>

                <p>Mr. JP Nadda, then Minister of Health and Family Welfare, in his address in the Lok Sabha in May 2016, revealed that according to the National Commission on Macroeconomics and Health (2005), about 10-20 million Indians were suffering from complex mental disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, whereas nearly 50 million Indians were suffering from common mental disorders like depression and anxiety. With growing awareness of Mental Health and Mental Illnesses in India, the Mental Healthcare Bill was revised in 2017, bringing reformative changes to enhance the availability and scope of Mental Health services in the Country. To support the mandate of the Mental Healthcare Bill our company was initiated for developing comprehensive self-help tools for emotional wellness.</p>
                <p>In today’s competitive world no one can escape the various stresses that we are exposed to different situations. And all of us are in fact at a higher risk of being stressed owing to the standards they have to live up to.</p>
                <p>The various stresses that we may come across are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Interpersonal stress</li>
                    <li>Relationship stress</li>
                    <li>Emotional stress</li>
                    <li>Family stress</li>
                    <li>Performance pressure</li>
                    <li>Work life balance</li>
                    <li>Burnout phenomenon</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And the list goes on.</p>
                <p>Notably most of us cannot talk about these issues as they feel shy, embarrassed or simply cannot identify that they need help for dealing with these issues. And it is a well-known fact that these kind of hidden issues surely impact our performance, especially while delivering results and achieving set targets.</p>
